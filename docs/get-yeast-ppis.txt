Rob Nash (rnash@stanford.edu) @ SGD Help Desk:

Mike forwarded this email so I can take you through the steps needed to get the interactions you need. The simplest way to get the most up to date and complete set of interactions would be to use YeastMIne (https://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/yeastmine/begin.do) our data warehouse where you can search and retrieve information available at SGD. 

Once you are in YeastMIne, we have a query (template) in the category “Interactions”, named “Gene -> Interaction" where you can specify a single gene or a list. There is a list “ALL_Verified_Uncharacterized_Dubious_ORFs” option in the pulldown containing all ORFs. However, there are some physical interactions that involve features other than ORFs, so this would not be complete.  

Instead there is a templated query in the category “Downloads” named "Retrieve all interactions for all genes.” and you could run this and obtain all genetic and physical interactions for all features. However, there are currently about 1,504,267 rows of interactions so the file would be very large and the query would take some time to run. To make things faster I modified the query to obtain just the physical interactions for features at SGD.

I am going to include the XML for the modified query below. All you need to do is click on the tab “QueryBuilder” (located at the top) and on the left there is an option labeled “Import query from XML”. Here is the URL where you would start: https://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/yeastmine/customQuery.do 

Then paste in this XML:

<query name="" model="genomic" view="Gene.secondaryIdentifier Gene.symbol Gene.interactions.participant2.secondaryIdentifier Gene.interactions.participant2.symbol Gene.interactions.details.experiment.name Gene.interactions.details.relationshipType Gene.interactions.details.annotationType Gene.interactions.details.note Gene.interactions.details.phenotype Gene.interactions.details.role1 Gene.interactions.details.experiment.interactionDetectionMethods.identifier Gene.interactions.details.experiment.publication.pubMedId Gene.interactions.details.experiment.publication.pubXrefId Gene.interactions.details.experiment.publication.citation" longDescription="Retrieve all interactions for all genes." sortOrder="Gene.secondaryIdentifier asc" constraintLogic="A and B">
  <constraint path="Gene.interactions.participant2" type="Gene"/>
  <constraint path="Gene.organism.shortName" code="A" op="=" value="S. cerevisiae"/>
  <constraint path="Gene.interactions.details.relationshipType" code="B" op="=" value="physical"/>
</query>

The click “submit” (bottom right), followed by  "Show Results” (top right). Give it a minute to run, and you will now have all physical interactions for all features (339, 027 rows in total). Now you can perform further analysis or you can simply export the results by selecting the “Export” option (top right). Before you download the file you can see that the default option will download as a tab separated file (.tsv) and note there are other download format options in the pull down. Also, on the left side there is an option to include a column header if that is helpful. Just select the option and the checkbox next to “Add column headers”. Then select “Download file” (bottom right) and give it a minute to generate the complete file. The “results.tsv” file can be opened, and you can then copy and paste this into excel or other software to take a look at the interactions.

YeastMIne is a very powerful tool to obtain and analyze data. If you create a user account and log in (top right) any analysis you perform will be saved from session to session. I would also recommend that you take some time, at your leisure, to view some of our video tutorials for YeastMIne as this will help you to learn how to use this tool for analysis:

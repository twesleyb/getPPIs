# getPPIs
Compiling experimentally identified protein protein interactions (PPIs) from 
the __HitPredict__ database [^1].

# Motivation
This package facilitates downloading and compiling PPIs from the HitPredict database.
Of the xxx unique proteins in the HitPredict database, xxx (yyy%) were successfully 
mapped to Entrez IDs.

In total, this consisted of XXX proteins and YYY protein-protein interactions.

## HitPredict
[HitPredict](http://hintdb.hgc.jp/htp/)
> Protein-protein interactions from IntAct, BioGRID, HPRD, MINT and DIP are combined, annotated and scored. The reliability score is calculated based on the experimental details of each interaction and the sequence, structure and functional annotations of the interacting proteins

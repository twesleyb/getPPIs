Compiling experimentally identified protein protein interactions (PPIs) from the __HitPredict__ database.

## HitPredict
[HitPredict](http://hintdb.hgc.jp/htp/)
> Protein-protein interactions from IntAct, BioGRID, HPRD, MINT and DIP are combined, annotated and scored. The reliability score is calculated based on the experimental details of each interaction and the sequence, structure and functional annotations of the interacting proteins

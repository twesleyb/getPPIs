# getPPIs

## Description
_getPPIs_ is an __R__ package containing a compilation of experimentally identified,
confidence scored protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from
[HitPredict](http://hintdb.hgc.jp/htp/).  Simply load a `data.frame` containing the PPI data using
`data(musInteractome)` or `data(hsInteractome)`.

For more information about HitPredict, please see authors' original publications:

```R
devtools::install_github("twesleyb/getPPIs")
```

## Usage

```R
library(getPPIs)

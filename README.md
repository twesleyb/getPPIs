# getPPIs
Compiling protein protein interactions (PPIs) from several databases. 


Mouse and human protein-protein interactions were were compiled from:  
* [1] [HitPredict](http://hintdb.hgc.jp/htp/): Human and mouse.
* [2] [BioGRID](https://thebiogrid.org/): Mouse, experimentally determined.
* [3] [STRING](https://string-db.org/): Mouse: Experimentally determined intractions. 
* [4] [APID](http://cicblade.dep.usal.es:8080/APID/init.action): known experimentally validated PPIs. 
* [5] [HPRD](http://www.hprd.org/): experimentally determined interactions.  

Human genes were mapped to homologous mouse genes using the [MGI](http://www.informatics.jax.org/) database.

# getPPIs
Compiling protein protein interactions (PPIs) from several databases. 


Mouse and human protein-protein interactions were were compiled from:  
* [1] HitPredict: Human and mouse: http://hintdb.hgc.jp/htp/
* [2] BioGRID: Mouse, experimentally determined. https://thebiogrid.org/
* [3] STRING: Mouse: Experimentally determined intractions. 
* [4] APID: known experimentally validated PPIs. 
* [5] HPRD: experimentally determined interactions.  

Human genes were mapped to homologous mouse genes from MGI.

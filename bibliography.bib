abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Protein-protein interaction data used in the creation or prediction of molecular networks is usually obtained from large scale or high-throughput experiments. This experimental data is liable to contain a large number of spurious interactions. Hence, there is a need to validate the interactions and filter out the incorrect data before using them in prediction studies. {RESULTS}: In this study, we use a combination of 3 genomic features -- structurally known interacting Pfam domains, Gene Ontology annotations and sequence homology -- as a means to assign reliability to the protein-protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae determined by high-throughput experiments. Using Bayesian network approaches, we show that protein-protein interactions from high-throughput data supported by one or more genomic features have a higher likelihood ratio and hence are more likely to be real interactions. Our method has a high sensitivity (90\%) and good specificity (63\%). We show that 56\% of the interactions from high-throughput experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have high reliability. We use the method to estimate the number of true interactions in the high-throughput protein-protein interaction data sets in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens to be 27\%, 18\% and 68\% respectively. Our results are available for searching and downloading at http://helix.protein.osaka-u.ac.jp/htp/. {CONCLUSION}: A combination of genomic features that include sequence, structure and annotation information is a good predictor of true interactions in large and noisy high-throughput data sets. The method has a very high sensitivity and good specificity and can be used to assign a likelihood ratio, corresponding to the reliability, to each interaction.}

abstract = {Despite the availability of a large number of protein-protein interactions ({PPIs}) in several species, researchers are often limited to using very small subsets in a few organisms due to the high prevalence of spurious interactions. In spite of the importance of quality assessment of experimentally determined {PPIs}, a surprisingly small number of databases provide interactions with scores and confidence levels. We introduce {HitPredict} (http://hintdb.hgc.jp/htp/), a database with quality assessed {PPIs} in nine species. {HitPredict} assigns a confidence level to interactions based on a reliability score that is computed using evidence from sequence, structure and functional annotations of the interacting proteins. {HitPredict} was first released in 2005 and is updated annually. The current release contains 36,930 proteins with 176,983 non-redundant, physical interactions, of which 116,198 (66\%) are predicted to be of high confidence.}

abstract = {Inhibitory synapses dampen neuronal activity through postsynaptic hyperpolarization. The composition of the inhibitory postsynapse and the mechanistic basis of its regulation, however, remain poorly understood. We used an in vivo chemico-genetic proximity-labeling approach to discover inhibitory postsynaptic proteins. Quantitative mass spectrometry not only recapitulated known inhibitory postsynaptic proteins but also revealed a large network of new proteins, many of which are either implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders or are of unknown function. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ({CRISPR}) depletion of one of these previously uncharacterized proteins, {InSyn1}, led to decreased postsynaptic inhibitory sites, reduced the frequency of miniature inhibitory currents, and increased excitability in the hippocampus. Our findings uncover a rich and functionally diverse assemblage of previously unknown proteins that regulate postsynaptic inhibition and might contribute to developmental brain disorders.

abstract = {Excitatory synapse formation during development involves the complex orchestration of both structural and functional alterations at the postsynapse. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie excitatory synaptogenesis are only partially resolved, in part because the internal machinery of developing synapses is largely unknown. To address this, we apply a chemicogenetic approach, in vivo biotin identification ({iBioID}), to discover aspects of the proteome of nascent synapses. This approach uncovered sixty proteins, including a previously uncharacterized protein, {CARMIL3}, which interacts in vivo with the synaptic cytoskeletal regulator proteins {SrGAP3} (or {WRP}) and actin capping protein. Using new {CRISPR}-based approaches, we validate that endogenous {CARMIL3} is localized to developing synapses where it facilitates the recruitment of capping protein and is required for spine structural maturation and {AMPAR} recruitment associated with synapse unsilencing. Together these proteomic and functional studies reveal a previously unknown mechanism important for excitatory synapse development in the developing perinatal brain.}

abstract = {{HitPredict} is a consolidated resource of experimentally identified, physical protein-protein interactions with confidence scores to indicate their reliability. The study of genes and their inter-relationships using methods such as network and pathway analysis requires high quality protein-protein interaction information. Extracting reliable interactions from most of the existing databases is challenging because they either contain only a subset of the available interactions, or a mixture of physical, genetic and predicted interactions. Automated integration of interactions is further complicated by varying levels of accuracy of database content and lack of adherence to standard formats. To address these issues, the latest version of {HitPredict} provides a manually curated dataset of 398 696 physical associations between 70 808 proteins from 105 species. Manual confirmation was used to resolve all issues encountered during data integration. For improved reliability assessment, this version combines a new score derived from the experimental information of the interactions with the original score based on the features of the interacting proteins. The combined interaction score performs better than either of the individual scores in {HitPredict} as well as the reliability score of another similar database. {HitPredict} provides a web interface to search proteins and visualize their interactions, and the data can be downloaded for offline analysis. Data usability has been enhanced by mapping protein identifiers across multiple reference databases. Thus, the latest version of {HitPredict} provides a significantly larger, more reliable and usable dataset of protein-protein interactions from several species for the study of gene groups.
